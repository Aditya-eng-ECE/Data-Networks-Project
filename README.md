Title - Optimizing data rate of a n-channel wireless network

The motivation of this project was to create a convex optimization problem that could be solved using Drift Plus Penalty algorithm. We established a scenario considering multiple users trying to browse internet via a WiFi Access Point. The Access Point has a maximum Transmission Power limit on each of the channels a user is accessing the internet on. We chose data rate as a network utility to be maximized subject to constraint of available power on a wireless channel. 

The convex optimization problem is described below -
